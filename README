Deployment Checklist
====================

Adds Capistrano task which is triggered before 'deploy' command and ask any numbers
of deployment checklist questions that must be validated or deployment aborts.

Questions are managed through a deploy_checklist.yml configuration file which should 
reside in RAILS_ROOT/config/. The plugin install.rb file automatically copies a default
YAML file to this location.


Disable Checklist
===========================

If you're using multi-stage deployments through something like capistrano-ext and
only want the checklist to apply to a specific environment (e.g. production), you
can disable the checklist by adding the following to the relevant capistrano 
config file.

set :use_deployment_checklist, false


Example Checklist YAML file
===========================

--- 
- question: Is Google Analytics code installed on all pages? y/N
  failure_message: Please install Google Analytics
	valid_answer: yep

The default answer is 'y' or 'Y' but this can be over-ridden in the YAML config
file by specifying 'valid_answer:'
